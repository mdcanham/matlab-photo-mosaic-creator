function [array] = GetGridAverages(cells)
%GetGridAverages Computes the average RGB values for each cell in the cell
%array.
%   Input:
%       cells = A cell array containing our main image split up into cells.
%   Output:
%       array = A 3 dimensional array that contains the average RGB values
%       for each of the cells.

%Find out how many rows and how many columns exist within the cell array.
[rows, cols] = size(cells);

%Begin the for loop that will step through the cell array and create a 3
%dimensional array for every value in the cell array, containing average
%RGB values.
