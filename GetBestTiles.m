function [tileIndex] = GetBestTiles(gridAverages, tile)
%GetBestTile will return the best tiles to use to fill the grids that have
%been created over our image.
%   Inputs:
%       gridAverages = A 3 dimensional array that contains the average RGB
%       values for each of the cells that have been created over the
%       original image.
%       tile = A 2 dimensional numerical array where each row corresponds 
%       to the average red, green and blue values for a tile.
%   Output:
%       tileIndex = The index number of the tile that should be used in the
%       place of the grid cell.
