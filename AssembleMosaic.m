function [mosaic] = AssembleMosaic(index,images)
%AssembleMosaic will take the index of images and put them
%together to return the final assembled mosaic as an RGB image.
%   Input:
%       index = A 2 dimensional array containing the index of the best
%       tile to select.
%       images = A 1 dimensional cell array containing the RGB images for
%       the tiles.
%   Output:
%       mosaic = The final assembled mosaic as a 3 dimensional RGB image.
